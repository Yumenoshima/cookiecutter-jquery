## Branches

### master
This branch is @audreyr's own "opinionated" ultimate jQuery plugin template for projects. It started off as [jQuery Boilerplate](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate), but it has since been adapted
for @audreyr's preferences:
* Follows [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html) instead of the [jQuery Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)

### jquery-boilerplate
This branch aims to be as close as possible to the original [jquery-boilerplate](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/), which I'm a big fan of. If it ever gets out of date, pull requests against this branch are appreciated.

## Similar Cookiecutters

* [cookiecutter-jswidget](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-jswidget) is like a non-jQuery-dependent version of this.
