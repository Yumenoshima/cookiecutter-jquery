Cookiecutter template for a jQuery plugin. See https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.

This is initially based on [jQuery Boilerplate](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate),
which I'm a big fan of.

But it will grow as I turn it into my own "opinionated" ultimate jQuery plugin
template for my projects.
